Horizontal distance between two nodes in binary tree
-----------------------------------------------------

What is this?
-------------
 - This is program to find horizontal distance between first and last node at same level in binary tree.
 - It must calculate the nodes which are not present.
 - The solution has two variants,
    - Solution 1 need to be passed root node of the tree. It will tell distance between all the nodes at same level
    - Solution 2 need to be passed two nodes along with root node of the tree. It return the distance between specified nodes
 - Python 3.6+ is supported


Includes
--------

- `binary_tree.py` has binary tree blueprint
- `main.py` is driver code for solutions.

How to run
----------
- run the `main.py` to get the output
- Solution 2 can be tested with any two nodes in same level (check last line)

Constraints
-----------
- Code is optimized for python 3.6+ only
- Code is cross platform (Windows/UNIX)
- No need to create env. no third party dependencies used
