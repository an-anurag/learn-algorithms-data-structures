"""
Given 2 arrays X, Y consisting of N integers each, returns the number of occurences of the fraction that appears most
often
eg: X =[1, 2, 3, 4, 0], Y = [2, 3, 6, 8, 4] the function should return 3, as fractions 1/2, 3/6, 4/8 are all equal to
each other.
eg: X = [3, 3, 4], Y = [5, 4, 3] should return 1, as no two fractions are equal
