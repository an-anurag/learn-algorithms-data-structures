"""
Given an array A consisting of strings, your function should calculate the length of the longest string S such that:

S is a concatenation of some of the strings from A;
Every letter in S is different

Write a function that given an arr A consisting of N strings, calculates the length of the longest string S fulfilling
the conditions above. If no such string exists, your function should return 0
A = ['co', 'dil', 'ity'] should return 5. The resulting string S could be the 'codil', 'dilco', 'coity', 'ityco'
